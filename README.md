# Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

## Project/Goals
-Download and import data from the provided CSV files(located in the CSVs folder) into my local ecommercDB
-Explore/Study the imported data to gather possible insights, while also keeping an eye for garbage data
-Transform the DB tables, using SQL to clean usable data
-Save and upload notes onto the README to chronicle my process for future reference

## Process
### (your step 1)
### (your step 2)

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
-   While importing the data i found it difficult to choose the correct datatypes while creating the table columns in the database. 
    I found it especially challenging during this part of the process to choose how large these datatypes needed to be to accomodate the data from the table. 
    I think i chose the lazy way and just ommitted sizes and chose a general but appropriate datatypes for some of the columns i was having issues with and just let postgreSQL figure it out for me during the import.
    Taking a look at the SQLs folder you can see the queries i used to create the tables and see what i mean by "lazy". But i didnt have a better answer at the time.


## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
