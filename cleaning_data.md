What issues will you address by cleaning the data?
--While importing the dataset, I've already briefly explored the data to be able to choose accurate datatypes(Though some of my choices might have been inaccurate)

--I'm going to remove any duplicate data I find through my queries

--I'm torn on whether or not to delete entries tied to empty/irrelevent data
    
--I noticed while scrolling through the data in excel that alot of the City data is ismply not available for some reason.
Right now I'm choosing to leave this column in but I will change the entries from 'Not Available in demo dataset' to just 'N/A'
I will use similar methods to address other missing/inaccurate data for columns that have Accurate and useful data mixed in

--If i have time or the capacity to. i would like to learn how to fix any spelling errors for otherwise useful data




Queries:
Below, provide the SQL queries you used to clean your data.
I will also be creating actual .SQL files of these queries and place them in the SQLs folder.
