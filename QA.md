What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

-   Performance wise i dont think any of my code is too inneficient... at least on my machine nothing took more than a few seconds to return my query results and for that reason i dont know whether or not my code has good performance and it might be on of my risk areas.
-   Data integrity is definitly one of my risk areas. the whole cleaning process had me pulling my hair trying to understand what values to remove or rename but iwthin my saved queries i dont think that i overlooked these instances of garbage data and properly filtered them out DURING the query but i was hesitant to alter any of the raw data too much
